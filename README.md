## Full Stack Developer's Oath
Full stack development is extremely hard, which is why I will use all possible means to make it easier.
1. **Browser Developer Console**: I will have my browser developer console open at all times.
2. **Network Tab**: I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that the frontend and backend are communicating as expected.
3. **Server State Monitoring**: I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to ensure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved as expected.
4. **Database Monitoring**: I will keep an eye on the database to ensure that the backend saves data there in the right format.
5. **Progress in Small Steps**: I will progress with small steps.
6. **Frontend and Backend Verification**: 
   - When I suspect a bug in the frontend, I will ensure that the backend works as expected.
   - When I suspect a bug in the backend, I will ensure that the frontend works as expected.
7. **Debugging with Console Logs**: I will write lots of `console.log` statements to ensure I understand how the code and tests behave and to help pinpoint problems.
8. **Code Troubleshooting**: If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I will start deleting it until it works or return to a state where everything was still working.
9. **Test Verification**: If a test does not pass, I will ensure that the tested functionality works properly in the application.
10. **Seeking Help**: When I ask for help in the course Discord channel or elsewhere, I will formulate my questions properly.
